## Projects
### Optimized machine learning models for landslide susceptibility mapping
[Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954124001250)

I developed an ensemble machine learning approach using **Python and geospatial data analysis** to assess landslide susceptibility by analyzing the correlation between historical landslides and geo-environmental factors. Using multiple models, including SVM, LR, LDA, RF, and XGBoost, I compared different random point selection methods (slope threshold and buffer-based) for mapping landslide risk. The ensemble model achieved high performance, with an AUC-ROC of 99.4% in one scenario. My method optimally identifies landslide-prone areas for better disaster risk management and land use planning.

### Edu-Navigator Chatbot: AI-powered chatbot for HBCU students using 

Used **Python and Prompt engineering** to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 turbo engine to develop the Edu Navigator Chatbot for HBCU students to navigate through their education journey. We designed the chatbot to help guide students through their educational journey by providing personalized advice, resources, and answers to common questions related to academics, campus life, and student services. By leveraging Python for the back-end development and fine-tuning the model with specific prompts, the chatbot was able to offer targeted, relevant, and user-friendly assistance to enhance the student experience.
