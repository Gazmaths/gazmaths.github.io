## Career Objectives
I‚Äôm Gazali Agboola, a Ph.D. candidate in **Data Science and Analytics** at **North Carolina A&T State University**, with a strong focus on **machine learning**, **deep learning**, time series forecasting, and causal inference. My research spans disaster management, geospatial analysis, and intelligent systems for real-world impact. Currently, I serve as a **Data Science Research Assistant**, developing models that achieve over 99% accuracy in landslide susceptibility mapping and working on knowledge graphs for evacuation systems.

Before academia, I worked at FrieslandCampina WAMCO in Nigeria, leading projects in credit risk, demand forecasting, and business operations. Through data-driven decision-making, I significantly improved performance metrics and revenue.

I am highly proficient in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **SAS**, and **SAP**, and I enjoy building AI solutions using **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS. I have worked on projects involving predictive machine learning, computer vision, and unsupervised models for anomaly and change detection. Some of my projects  include landslide detection, credit card fraud analysis, and AI-driven chatbots like Edu-Navigator using GPT-3.5 Turbo. You‚Äôll find more about my work below:

## Hobbies
### Playing Chess
Chess has been more than just a game for me‚Äîit‚Äôs a way to train focus, strategy, and foresight, which aligns well with my work in AI and data science. Whether I‚Äôm coding a new deep learning model or preparing for a research presentation, I often find parallels in chess as it relates to problem solving. It teaches me to think multiple steps ahead, embrace uncertainty, and stay calm under pressure.
