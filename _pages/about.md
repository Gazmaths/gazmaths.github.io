## Career Objectives
I’m Gazali Agboola, a Ph.D. candidate in **Data Science and Analytics** at **North Carolina A&T State University**, with a strong focus on **machine learning**, **deep learning**, time series forecasting, and causal inference. My research spans disaster management, geospatial analysis, and intelligent systems for real-world impact. Currently, I serve as a **Data Science Research Assistant**, developing models that achieve over 99% accuracy in landslide susceptibility mapping and working on knowledge graphs for evacuation systems.

Before academia, I worked at FrieslandCampina WAMCO in Nigeria, leading projects in credit risk, demand forecasting, and business operations. Through data-driven decision-making, I significantly improved performance metrics and revenue.

I am highly proficient in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **SAS**, and **SAP**, and I enjoy building robust AI solutions using **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. I’ve developed systems for landslide detection, credit card fraud analysis, and AI-driven chatbots like Edu-Navigator using GPT-3.5 Turbo. You’ll find more about my work below:

## Hobbies
### Playing Chess
Chess has been more than just a game for me—it’s a way to train focus, strategy, and foresight, which aligns well with my work in AI and data science. Whether I’m coding a new deep learning model or preparing for a research presentation, I often find parallels in chess as it relates to problem solving. It teaches me to think multiple steps ahead, embrace uncertainty, and stay calm under pressure.
