## üß†Machine Learning Models Applications
### Automatic Model Hyperparameters GridSearch for Classification Models Using Python and Streamlit

* This project is a modular machine learning pipeline built using Python and Streamlit. Through an intuitive web interface, users can preprocess data, explore datasets, train machine learning models, and make predictions on unseen data. The pipeline supports a machine learning workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation and prediction.

### Optimizing Landslide Susceptibility Models through Ensemble Classification Techniques
The purpose of this study is to assess how well machine learning models perform on landslide susceptibility mapping. For Polk County, Western North Carolina, seven distinct models were examined for landslide susceptibility modeling: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and ensemble techniques (Stacking and Weighted Average). A dataset of 1215 historical landslide events and 1215 non-landslide sites, along with fourteen geographic data layers, is used to evaluate these models.
Metrics including accuracy, F1-score, Kappa score, and AUC-ROC are used to assess these models' performance, with a focus on how non-landslide random sampling affects model outcomes.

With an AUC-ROC of 91.8% for the buffer-based scenario and 99.4% for the slope threshold scenario, the weighted average ensemble of the five models yielded the best results. This demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in landslide susceptibility mapping, offering a strong instrument for pinpointing high-risk regions and guiding plans for disaster risk reduction.
