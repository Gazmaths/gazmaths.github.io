## üß†Machine Learning Pipeline with Streamlit
### Automatic Model Hyperparameters GridSearch for Classification Models

* This project is a modular machine learning pipeline built using Python and Streamlit. Through an intuitive web interface, users can preprocess data, explore datasets, train machine learning models, and make predictions on unseen data. The pipeline supports a machine learning workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation and prediction.

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-Visit_App-red?logo=streamlit&logoColor=white)](https://mlclassificationpipeline.streamlit.app/)

**Features**
* Preprocessing: Handle missing values and outliers with user-defined options.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze target correlation and generate pairplots for insights.
* Model Training: Train and tune multiple models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVC) using GridSearchCV.
* Model Selection and Evaluation: Automatically pick the best model and evaluate its performance.
* Prediction: Predict outcomes for unseen data with a trained model.
* Visualization: View feature contributions using SHAP.

**Files and Structure**
preprocess.py: Functions for data preprocessing (missing values, outliers).
explore.py: Functions for exploratory data analysis.
train.py: Functions for training and tuning machine learning models.
model.py: Functions for selecting the best model and evaluating feature importance.
prediction.py: Functions for preprocessing and predicting outcomes on unseen data.
classification_app.py: The main Streamlit app that integrates all modules.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies for the project.

**How to Run**
* Install dependencies:
* Copy code
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Start the Streamlit app:
* bash
* Copy code
