Abstract -- In the financial sector, financial fraud is a rising problem with serious effects. The identification of credit card fraud in online transactions was greatly helped by big data analysis. Due to two main factors—first, the profiles of legitimate and fraudulent behavior change often, and second, credit card
fraud data sets are extremely skewed—detection of credit card fraud, a data mining challenge, becomes difficult. The dataset sampling strategy, variable choice, and detection methods employed all have significant impacts on the effectiveness of fraud detection in credit card transactions. The performance of isolation forest (iForest), local outliers’ factor(LOF), and Logistic regression (LR) on highly skewed credit card fraud data are examined in this study. The model was constructed using real data from European cardholders, and under-sampling methods were also applied. The three models were implemented in Python, and the effectiveness of the methods is assessed based on accuracy, recall, precision, and the Kappa score coefficient. The outcomes indicate that Isolation Forest has the best accuracy at 99.8% in detecting outliers.

### Optimizing Landslide Susceptibility Models through Ensemble Classification Techniques
This study aims to assess how well machine learning models perform on landslide susceptibility mapping. For Polk County, Western North Carolina, seven distinct models were examined for landslide susceptibility modeling: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and ensemble techniques (Stacking and Weighted Average). A dataset of 1215 historical landslide events and 1215 non-landslide sites, as well as fourteen geographic data layers, is used to evaluate these models.
Metrics including accuracy, F1-score, Kappa score, and AUC-ROC are used to assess these models' performance, with a focus on how non-landslide random sampling affects model outcomes.

The buffer-based scenario's AUC-ROC was 91.8%, and the slope threshold scenario's was 99.4%. The weighted average ensemble of the five models yielded the best results. This demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in landslide susceptibility mapping, offering a strong instrument for pinpointing high-risk regions and guiding plans for disaster risk reduction.

## 🤖 Generative AI Applications and Building Chatbots with Pre-trained LLM Models
### Creating EDU-Navigator for HBCU students(HP Future of Work Academy (FOWA) Challenge)

I worked as a software developer on a team named "20," consisting of 5 members, to develop the EDU-Navigator chatbot for HBCU students. The chatbot, powered by the Chat-GPT turbo engine, was designed to help students navigate their educational journey. Our team received an honorable mention in the HP Future of Work Academy (FOWA) Challenge.
